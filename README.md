Support function to plot data evenly in the [Inverse Pole Figure triangle (FCC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_figure). The method is based on [Voronoi tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) produced from the spherical projection of a [Fibonacci sphere](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9600801/evenly-distributing-n-points-on-a-sphere).
